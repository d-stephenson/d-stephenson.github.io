<i>Strategic Problem Solving</i>

JOURNAL #TWO [SYD701]

<h2>Strategic Problem Solving</h2>
 
Problem-solving is a foundational skill if we are to resolve all types of issues faced in both business situations and software development. Understanding the type of problems teams face is instrumental to allow them to be managed and ultimately solved, particularly with the uncertainty in software and the need for companies to adapt quickly to changing market environments, which often lead to decision making with limited or incomplete information.
 
<h3>Real-world issues - Critical Analysis</h3>
 
Before we discuss the types of challenges teams face it is important to look at some real-world issues.
 
<i>Issue: Students and staff often comment (complain!) about the difficulty of finding car parking spaces at NMIT.</i>
 
<b>Solution</b>
 
Construct a multistorey car park in the parking area in front of G Block (a large car park on the NMIT campus). If there is sufficient funding available and a bureaucratic will to pursue a project of this scale, it could prove to be a simple and relatively inexpensive solution given the recognised constraints. Many of these structures have been constructed using precast concrete that can reduce the construction time and cost. There is of course a significant problem created from such a solution, Nelson is in a region of New Zealand that is seismically active. Therefore, seismic retrofits should be applied to the structure, which when factored into the solution, may make it unfeasible.
 
<i>Issue: What should the Nelson City Council do to prepare for the impact of climate change?</i>
 
<b>Solution</b>
 
To begin, the Council should obtain all relevant data where it is available to understand the rate of coastal erosion and the anticipated sea-level rise considering Nelson's geographically location on Tasman Bay. The information can be used to determine a worst-case scenario for ratepayers, including the impact of doing nothing as a viable alternative. If the impact is deemed low then the Council should do nothing and instead focus on more regional social and economic problems that are of greater concern to residents. Should the effects likely impact infrastructure, the economy, residential property and economic development, then research must take place with a view to implement proven solutions that are capable of protecting these assets. Most of all, those tasked with drafting a plan should be realistic and measured, they should take a scientific approach that avoids decisions based on the heightened emotions surrounding this problem.
 
<h3>Puzzles, Problems, and Messes</h3>
 
> "One of the greatest mistakes that can be made when dealing with a mess is to carve off part of the mess, treat it as a problem and then solve it as a puzzle - ignoring its links with other aspects of the mess‚Äù. (Pidd, 1996)
 
Defining the challenge or issue is the crucial first step for business leaders and software developers when trying to describe and work through complex problems. The decision analyst Russell Ackoff described challenges split into three categories:
 
- Messes
- Problems
- Puzzles 
 
<h4>Messes</h4>
 
A mess is a highly complex issue without a well-defined form or structure. When a problem is described as a mess it is often difficult to know what the nature of the problem is, making a solution tricky to find and impossible to implement. Crises that affect the world as a whole are often described as complex, including:
 
<b>U.S. interventionism and the war in Ukraine</b>
 
Conflicting security concerns and economic dominance has led to prior 2014 U.S. intervention in Ukraine, in addition to Europe's increasing reliance on Russian gas reserves versus U.S. gas output and its self-declared role as the global law enforcer has had a causal effect on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The problem can also be viewed in reverse, Russian security concerns and economic development issues relating to NATO expansion east and the significant reliance of gas sales to Europe.
 
<b>Governments Covid-19 response</b>
 
Global governmental Covid-19 responses can be argued as incompetent at best, resulting from officials and bureaucrats ignoring science as it is made available, instead choosing to stay true to cause despite said new evidence. A portion of elected officials has taken an emotional view that has been ineffective at producing a balanced strategy. Conversely, it could be argued that politicians have tried to do their best in a fast-developing situation and ever-changing political landscape.
 
<h4>Problems</h4>
 
Hierarchically, problems come after messes. These issues will have a defined structure or form but many potential solutions, with no clear path forward to provide the best fit solution. Examples of problems include:
 
<b>Manufacturer car recall</b>
 
A mechanical or technical feature has been found defective on cars sold throughout dealer networks worldwide. What is the best solution to correct the error and how should the manufacturer go about it within the regulatory framework?
 
<b>GDPR data mapping</b>
 
Companies need to become GDPR compliant to meet the legislation, what is the best solution to map an entire business system utilising disparate applications and databases? Where is the best place to start? What tools are available? How should we define the business processing activities?
 
<h4>Puzzles</h4>
 
Puzzles are the final defined issue, they have solid, well-defined structures and form with a specific solution that can be applied. Puzzles are encountered daily, including matching games such as Mahjong and jigsaw puzzles.
