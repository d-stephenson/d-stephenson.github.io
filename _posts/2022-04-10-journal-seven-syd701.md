<i>Soft Systems Methodology</i>

JOURNAL #SEVEN [SYD701]

<h2>Soft Systems Methodology</h2>
 
The Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) was created in response to the realisation that hard systems thinking techniques were incapable of managing increasing complexity and the high-level issues of large organisations. The approach of SSM is to explore the decision making processes with the intent to learn, appreciate and improve the organisation's purpose. All of the organisation's processes are the focus of the systemic methodology of SSM and not the distinct parts. The fundamental principles of computer-based information systems development allow the deployment of SSM to serve a purpose to human actions. This is realised in the form of the information system/information system development (IS/ISDM) model.
 
SSM looks at real-world activities that make up these processes, in conjunction with systems thinking about the real world. The goal is to gain insights into the problem situation by conducting interviews and meetings with stakeholders and management. The insights gained are represented through the creation of Rich Pictures and/or CATWOE. Concepts such as emergent properties, communication hierarchy and control support system thinking help to identify systems capable of providing useful information to stakeholders.
 
<h4>SSM Intervention</h4>
 
SSM has a clearly defined structure that must be understood by the practitioner to ensure it is deployed in a smart and flexible way. SSM intervention is a technique designed to break down the issues that make up a complex organisational problem for greater clarity. Once the issues are in an unstructured form, a conceptual model is created to support decision making and offer a discussion point for joint problem solving amongst stakeholders.
 
Stages of the SSM intervention include:
 
- Determining the situation
- Discuss different systems that could be deployed in the situation
- Measure the discussions against the systems
- Use the information learnt to take action
 
The stages outlined are not a route to the right answer, but act as an informed basis for taking positive action.
 
<h4>Steps to the SSM Model</h4>
 
There are seven steps that make up the SSM model. The steps do not represent a single process that must be followed through, but a flexible set of processes that can be applied to meet the needs of the organisation.
 
<b>Step 1:</b> Understand and appreciate the problem situation<br>
<b>Step 2:</b> Document the problem situation<br>
<b>Step 3:</b> Formulate root definitions<br>
<b>Step 4:</b> Create the conceptual models including formal system concepts and other systems thinking<br>
<b>Step 5:</b> Compare these models with real world scenario<br>
<b>Step 6:</b> Define any possible changes<br>
<b>Step 7:</b> Recommend appropriate or necessary actions<br>
 
The process is repeatable as necessary and designed so that all parties have the ability to learn about the organisation, the diversity within the organisation and fellow employees. Practical ways to move forward should be discussed throughout the process, these should be well thought out and options accommodated and re-thought through.
 
Step 3 is established to produce root definitions as two ways to go about this, Rich Picture and CATWOE.   
 
<h3>Root Definitions | Rich Picture</h3>
 
Complex systems are often better understood through the creation of visual communication aids. Rich Pictures are used in the SSM process to improve understanding and add value through the efficient, simple use of images. Although there are no well-structured rules surrounding the production of Rich Pictures, they do not include any form of syntax and are not restricted by notations that must be explained to a management structure made up of disparate departments. Rich Pictures are an excellent tool for providing a concise overview of a system, particularly where there is a desire to highlight requirements that are of significant consideration.
 
Rich Pictures can be used in daily business activities and practically speaking, can be as simple as a drawing on a whiteboard. They are not, however, without their disadvantages. Critics point to their unstructured format that uses symbols or metaphors that can be confusing or lead to conflicting viewpoints.
 
<h3>Root Definitions | CATWOE</h3>
 
CATWOE is a set of questions that can be asked to support the Rich Picture. CATWOE is made up of six components that can result in a well-formulated definition of the model. These are:
 
- Customer
- Actor
- Transformation process
- World View
- Owner
- Environmental Constraints
 
Users should formulate a question that aids in the understanding of each field. The model built using CATWOE will be developed over time as users and stakeholders engage and become better informed and knowledgeable about the system. The information obtained is expected to achieve positive results.
 
<h3>Benefits & Limitations of SSM</h3>
 
SSM has achieved proven results in complex organisations and political situations. It provides users with a methodology to deal with and manage the real word problem domain and find solutions that go beyond the technical.
 
The methodology is not without limitations, for instance, Step 4 lacks a definitive technique that enables comparisons to be made in the real world, nor is there a modelling tool to support the creation of the models. More broadly, solutions are generally harder to develop if participants have little experience or knowledge of the problem, reducing the effectiveness of system thinking. Other practical limitations can also arise:
 
- Participants may find adapting to this approach a challenge
- Users should be careful when defining the scope, narrowing it too early in the cycle can lead to problems later
- Assembling the Rich Picture without a structure or solution to the problem can be difficult, particularly when the real-world interpretation is loose
- The methodology faces challenges in the revision process that can lead to conflict, particularly when changes are implemented simultaneously
 
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 
SSM supports the identification of an unstructured problem holistically, targeting complex organisational business and process models. The methodology has been adapted to recognise changes in the organisational landscape and developments in technology to continue to provide a clear approach that supports changes that offer a complete best case solution to the problem.
